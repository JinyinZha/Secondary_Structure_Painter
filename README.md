# Secondary_Structure_Painter
Secondary Structure Painter (SSP) is a tool for plotting amino acid sequence of a protein with their seconday structure. SSP requires no installation on Windows and especially, outputs in a pptx format so that it could be further modified. 

# Brief Introduction
The secondary structure diagram of the protein sequence is a common way to demonstrate protein structures. The current tool (SSP) offers you an easy way to create these diagrams. Using a PDB file, PDB ID or Uniprot ID of the intersted protein as input, SSP could plot the diagrams in seconds. Importantly, the output style of SSP is in pptx format, suggesting that users could perform further modifications, based on their individual requirements, and is not limited by DPIs. Besides, SSP itself has also integrated many options to meet different requirements. SSP on windows is developed as a user-friendly GUI program requires no installation. It could also be used on other systems as long as you are familiar with Python.

# Usage
## 1, GUI on Windows
The easiest way to use SSP is to use the GUI program. Download "SSP_V1.rar" and unwrap it, in which you could find "SSP.exe". Double click the program to open it. You will first see a window for mode selection.
